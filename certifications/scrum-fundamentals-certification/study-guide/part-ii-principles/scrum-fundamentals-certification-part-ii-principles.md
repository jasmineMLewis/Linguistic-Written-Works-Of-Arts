# Scrum Principles
Six Scrum Principles are the foundation on of the Scrum framework and can be applied to any project.
- Empirical Process Control
- Self-Organization
- Collaboration
- Value-based Prioritization
- Time-boxing
- Iterative Development

***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Introduction | Page: 9

<br/>

# Empirical Process Control

![Image – Empirical Process Control](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/certifications/scrum-fundamentals-certification/assets/part-ii-principles/sfc-part-ii-principles-empirical-process-control.png)
 
<ins>***Empirical Process Control*** </ins> allows learning through observation and experimentation, a pivotal aspect in the Scrum's framework to complete projects or products when clear and concise upfront planning and details are not present at the beginning or mid-way through product development. This principle emphasizes the core philosophy of Scrum based on three main ideas: *transparency, inspection,* and *adaptation.*

<br/> 

## Transparency
Transparency allows all aspects of any Scrum process to be viewed by everyone. This ensures information is available throughout the organization and develops an open work culture.

There are three components of ***Transparency***:
- Artifacts
- Meetings
- Information Radiators

<br/>

There are four types of ***Artifacts***:
- Project Vision Statement
- Prioritized Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Release Planning Schedule

<br/>

There are five types of ***Meetings***:
- Sprint Planning Meetings
- Daily Standup Meetings
- Sprint Review Meetings
- Retrospect Sprint Meetings
- Release Planning Meeting

<br/>

There are three types of ***Information Radiators***:
- Sprint Burndown Chart
- Scrumboard
- Sprint Burnup Chart

<br/>

### Artifacts
- *Project Vision Statement* is viewable by business stakeholders and the Scrum Team.
- *Prioritized Product Backlog* displays prioritized User Stories for everyone to view.
- *Sprint Backlog* lists tasks associated with committed User Stories to be completed by Scrum team in current Sprint.
- *Release Planning Schedule* can coordinate work across multiple Scrum Teams and other business stakeholders.

<br/>

### Meetings
- *Sprint Planning Meetings* allow Scrum Teams to estimate time and commitment needed to deliver priority User Stories and commit to set of User Stories complete for a Sprint.
- *Daily Standup Meetings* conducted during the *Conduct Daily Standup* process, allows all team members to report their progress of a User Story or Bug from the previous day, what they plan to do, and any impediments preventing from completing task in the current Sprint.
- *Sprint Review Meetings* conducted during the *Demonstrate and Validate Sprint* process, Scrum Team demonstrates potentially shippable Sprint Deliverables to the Product Owner and business stakeholders.
- *Retrospect Sprint Meetings* conducted after the Sprint Review Meetings on the last day of the Sprint allows the Scrum Team to discuss improvement opportunities for future Sprints.
- *Release Planning Meeting* is conducted to enable the Scrum Team to have an overview of the planned releases and delivery schedule for development of the product.

<br/>

### Information Radiators
- *Sprint Burndown Chart*, *Scrumboard*, and *Sprint Burnup Chart* is visible to the Scrum Team to monitor progress.

***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Principles | Page: 22 - 23

<br/>

## Inspection
Inspection in Scrum is depicted through the following:
- *Scrumboard* and other Information Radiators demonstrate the progress of the Scrum Team on completing the tasks in the current Sprint.
- Frequent Feedback from the customer and other business stakeholders during the following processes: *Develop Epic(s), Create Prioritized Product Backlog, Conduct Release Planning, and Refine Prioritized Product Backlog.*
- Final Inspection and approval of deliverables by the Product Owner and the customer in *Demonstrate and Validate Sprint* process.

***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Principles | Page: 24

<br/>

## Adaptation
Adaptation allows the Scrum Core Team and business stakeholders learn through transparency and inspection to adapt by making improvement in their work.

There are multiple opportunities in the Scrum framework for ***Adaptation***, below are six areas for example:
- Daily Standup Meetings
- Constant Risk Identification
- Change Requests
- Scrum Guidance
- Retrospect Sprint Meetings
- Retrospect Project Meetings

<br/>

### Example of Opportunities for Adaptation
- In *Daily Standup Meetings*, Scrum Team members discuss impediments to completing tasks and seeking assistance from other team members. More experienced Scrum Team members mentor less experience in knowledge of the project or technology.
- *Risk* identification is performed and iterated throughout the project. Identified risks become inputs to several Scrum processes including *Create Prioritized Product Backlog, Refine Prioritized Product Backlog, and Demonstrate and Validate Sprint.*
- Change Requests can be created due to improvements which are discussed and approved during the *Develop Epic(s), Create Prioritized Product Backlog, and Refine Prioritized Product Backlog* processes.
- The Scrum Guidance Body interacts with Scrum Team members to offer guidance and provide expertise as required during the *Create User Stories, Estimate Tasks, Create Deliverables, and Refine Prioritized Product Backlog* processes.
- In *Retrospect Sprint Meetings* agreed actionable improvements are determined based on the outputs from the *Demonstrate and Validate Sprint* process.
- In *Retrospect Release Meeting*, participants document lessons learned and perform reviews seeking ways to improve processes and address inefficiencies.

<br/>


# Self-Organization

![Image – Self-Organization](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/certifications/scrum-fundamentals-certification/assets/part-ii-principles/sfc-part-ii-principles-self-organization.png)

<ins>***Self-Organization</ins> allows team members to deliver greater value because Scrum embraces the idea employees are self-motivated and seek greater responsibility. Scrum's leadership style is "supporting leadership" which focus its needs on the Scrum Team to achieve results.

<br/>

Within the ***Initiate*** phase, the Project Vision is defined in the *Create Project Vision* process, followed by selecting the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Scrum Team in the *Identify Scrum Master and Business Stakeholder(s)* and *Form Scrum Team* processes. The Scrum Core Team collaborate with business stakeholders to *Develop Epic(s)*, an ***Initiate*** phase's process and *Create User Stories* process in ***Plan and Estimate*** phase. The team's expertise determines technical and management input necessary to execute planned work of project during the *Create Deliverables* process in ***Implement*** phase.

<br/>

The Product Owner, Voice of Customer, prioritizes work, and tasks breakdown and estimation is completed by the self-organized Scrum Team during *Identify Tasks* and *Estimate Tasks* processes of ***Plan and Estimate*** phase. During these processes, the Scrum Team determine their work responsibilities, and assist the Product Owner to identity risks and dependencies. Throughout the Sprint, the Scrum Team interface daily through Daily Standup Meetings to discuss progress, impediments, and need of assistance. The Scrum Team interact with other teams through Scrum of Scrum (SoS) meetings.

<br/>

Finally, in ***Review and Retrospect*** phase's *Demonstrate and Validate Sprint* process, the Scrum Team and Scrum Master work together to show the product increment created during the Sprint and acceptance of completed deliverables. In ***Release*** phase's *Ship Deliverables* process, work is sent to production. Since the Prioritized Product Backlog arranges User Stories by value of importance, the Product Owner and customer can visualize value created after every Sprint.

<br/>

*Identification of Phases: Initiate, Plan and Estimate, Implement, Review and Retrospect, Release*

<br/> 

## Benefits of Self-Organization
The benefits of self-organization are the following:
- Ownership - collective buy-in and shared pride in work
- Motivation – leads to enhanced team performance
- Growth – innovative and creative environment
- Approach – satisfy requirements with simplest and best techniques
