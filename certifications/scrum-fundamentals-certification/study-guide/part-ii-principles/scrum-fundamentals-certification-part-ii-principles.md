# Scrum Principles
Six Scrum Principles are the foundation on of the Scrum framework and can be applied to any project.
- Empirical Process Control
- Self-Organization
- Collaboration
- Value-based Prioritization
- Time-boxing
- Iterative Development

***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Introduction | Page: 9

<br/>

# Empirical Process Control

![Image – Empirical Process Control](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/certifications/scrum-fundamentals-certification/assets/part-ii-principles/sfc-part-ii-principles-empirical-process-control.png)
 
<ins>***Empirical Process Control*** </ins> allows learning through observation and experimentation, a pivotal aspect in the Scrum's framework to complete projects or products when clear and concise upfront planning and details are not present at the beginning or mid-way through product development. This principle emphasizes the core philosophy of Scrum based on three main ideas: *transparency, inspection,* and *adaptation.*

<br/> 

## Transparency
Transparency allows all aspects of any Scrum process to be viewed by everyone. This ensures information is available throughout the organization and develops an open work culture.

There are three components of ***Transparency***:
- Artifacts
- Meetings
- Information Radiators

<br/>

There are four types of ***Artifacts***:
- Project Vision Statement
- Prioritized Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Release Planning Schedule

<br/>

There are five types of ***Meetings***:
- Sprint Planning Meetings
- Daily Standup Meetings
- Sprint Review Meetings
- Retrospect Sprint Meetings
- Release Planning Meeting

<br/>

There are three types of ***Information Radiators***:
- Sprint Burndown Chart
- Scrumboard
- Sprint Burnup Chart

<br/>

### Artifacts
- *Project Vision Statement* is viewable by business stakeholders and the Scrum Team.
- *Prioritized Product Backlog* displays prioritized User Stories for everyone to view.
- *Sprint Backlog* lists tasks associated with committed User Stories to be completed by Scrum team in current Sprint.
- *Release Planning Schedule* can coordinate work across multiple Scrum Teams and other business stakeholders.

<br/>

### Meetings
- *Sprint Planning Meetings* allow Scrum Teams to estimate time and commitment needed to deliver priority User Stories and commit to set of User Stories complete for a Sprint.
- *Daily Standup Meetings* conducted during the *Conduct Daily Standup* process, allows all team members to report their progress of a User Story or Bug from the previous day, what they plan to do, and any impediments preventing from completing task in the current Sprint.
- *Sprint Review Meetings* conducted during the *Demonstrate and Validate Sprint* process, Scrum Team demonstrates potentially shippable Sprint Deliverables to the Product Owner and business stakeholders.
- *Retrospect Sprint Meetings* conducted after the Sprint Review Meetings on the last day of the Sprint allows the Scrum Team to discuss improvement opportunities for future Sprints.
- *Release Planning Meeting* is conducted to enable the Scrum Team to have an overview of the planned releases and delivery schedule for development of the product.

<br/>

### Information Radiators
- *Sprint Burndown Chart*, *Scrumboard*, and *Sprint Burnup Chart* is visible to the Scrum Team to monitor progress.

***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Principles | Page: 22 - 23

<br/>

## Inspection
Inspection in Scrum is depicted through the following:
- *Scrumboard* and other Information Radiators demonstrate the progress of the Scrum Team on completing the tasks in the current Sprint.
- Frequent Feedback from the customer and other business stakeholders during the following processes: *Develop Epic(s), Create Prioritized Product Backlog, Conduct Release Planning, and Refine Prioritized Product Backlog.*
- Final Inspection and approval of deliverables by the Product Owner and the customer in *Demonstrate and Validate Sprint* process.

***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Principles | Page: 24

<br/>

## Adaptation
Adaptation allows the Scrum Core Team and business stakeholders learn through transparency and inspection to adapt by making improvement in their work.

There are multiple opportunities in the Scrum framework for ***Adaptation***, below are six areas for example:
- Daily Standup Meetings
- Constant Risk Identification
- Change Requests
- Scrum Guidance
- Retrospect Sprint Meetings
- Retrospect Project Meetings

<br/>

### Example of Opportunities for Adaptation
- In *Daily Standup Meetings*, Scrum Team members discuss impediments to completing tasks and seeking assistance from other team members. More experienced Scrum Team members mentor less experience in knowledge of the project or technology.
- *Risk* identification is performed and iterated throughout the project. Identified risks become inputs to several Scrum processes including *Create Prioritized Product Backlog, Refine Prioritized Product Backlog, and Demonstrate and Validate Sprint.*
- Change Requests can be created due to improvements which are discussed and approved during the *Develop Epic(s), Create Prioritized Product Backlog, and Refine Prioritized Product Backlog* processes.
- The Scrum Guidance Body interacts with Scrum Team members to offer guidance and provide expertise as required during the *Create User Stories, Estimate Tasks, Create Deliverables, and Refine Prioritized Product Backlog* processes.
- In *Retrospect Sprint Meetings* agreed actionable improvements are determined based on the outputs from the *Demonstrate and Validate Sprint* process.
- In *Retrospect Release Meeting*, participants document lessons learned and perform reviews seeking ways to improve processes and address inefficiencies.

<br/>

# Self-Organization

![Image – Self-Organization](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/certifications/scrum-fundamentals-certification/assets/part-ii-principles/sfc-part-ii-principles-self-organization.png)

<ins>***Self-Organization*** </ins> allows team members to deliver greater value because Scrum embraces the idea employees are self-motivated and seek greater responsibility. Scrum's leadership style is "supporting leadership" which focus its needs on the Scrum Team to achieve results.

<br/>

Within the ***Initiate*** phase, the Project Vision is defined in the *Create Project Vision* process, followed by selecting the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Scrum Team in the *Identify Scrum Master and Business Stakeholder(s)* and *Form Scrum Team* processes. The Scrum Core Team collaborate with business stakeholders to *Develop Epic(s)*, an ***Initiate*** phase's process and *Create User Stories* process in ***Plan and Estimate*** phase. The team's expertise determines technical and management input necessary to execute planned work of project during the *Create Deliverables* process in ***Implement*** phase.

<br/>

The Product Owner, Voice of Customer, prioritizes work, and tasks breakdown and estimation is completed by the self-organized Scrum Team during *Identify Tasks* and *Estimate Tasks* processes of ***Plan and Estimate*** phase. During these processes, the Scrum Team determine their work responsibilities, and assist the Product Owner to identity risks and dependencies. Throughout the Sprint, the Scrum Team interface daily through Daily Standup Meetings to discuss progress, impediments, and need of assistance. The Scrum Team interact with other teams through Scrum of Scrum (SoS) meetings.

<br/>

Finally, in ***Review and Retrospect*** phase's *Demonstrate and Validate Sprint* process, the Scrum Team and Scrum Master work together to show the product increment created during the Sprint and acceptance of completed deliverables. In ***Release*** phase's *Ship Deliverables* process, work is sent to production. Since the Prioritized Product Backlog arranges User Stories by value of importance, the Product Owner and customer can visualize value created after every Sprint.

***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Principles| Page: 27

<br/>

*Identification of Phases: Initiate, Plan and Estimate, Implement, Review and Retrospect, Release*
<br/>

<br/>

## Benefits of Self-Organization
The benefits of self-organization are the following:
- Ownership - collective buy-in and shared pride in work
- Motivation – leads to enhanced team performance
- Growth – innovative and creative environment
- Approach – satisfy requirements with simplest and best techniques

***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Principles| Page: 27

# Collaboration

![Image – Collaboration](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/certifications/scrum-fundamentals-certification/assets/part-ii-principles/sfc-part-ii-principles-collaboration.png) 

 
<ins>***Collaboration*** </ins> is the Scrum Core Team working together and liaising with business stakeholders to create and validate deliverables of the project to meet goals outlined in the Project Vision

during the ***Initiate*** phase. Cooperation occurs when work product consists of the sum of work efforts of various team members. Collaboration occurs when a team works together to play off each other's inputs to produce a greater product. To achieve full collaboration, establishing trust between team members and between team members and business stakeholders. Collaborative work three core dimensions are *awareness*, *articulation*, and *appropriation*.

<br/>

### Awareness
Individuals working together need to be aware of each other's work.

<br/>

### Articulation
Individuals collaborating must partition work into sections, divide sections among team members, and after work completion, reintegrate work.

<br/>

### Appropriation
Adapt technology to one's own situation; technology may be used in a manner completely different than expected by designers.

***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Principles | Page: 29

<br/>

## Benefits of Collaboration in Scrum Projects
"Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation" is emphasized in The Agile Manifesto written in 2001 by Martin Fowler and Jim Highsmith. The Scrum framework approach is to allow the Scrum Core Team members (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Scrum Team) collaborate with each other and business stakeholders to create deliverables that provide the greatest possible value to the customer.  


Collaboration ensures the following project benefits are realized:
- Change Requests are minimized.
- Risks are efficiently identified and mitigated.
- Efficiency is increased.
- Continuous improvement is incorporated.

<br/>
 

### Change Requests are minimized.
The need for changes due to poorly refined requirements are minimized.

<ins>***Example*** </ins>   

During the ***Initiate*** phases' *Create Project Vision*, *Develop Epic(s)*, and *Create Prioritized Product Backlog* processes, the Product Owner collaborates with business stakeholders to create the Project Vision, Epic(s), and Prioritized Product Backlog. This ensures clarity for Scrum Core Team members work that is required to complete the project. Through a transparent Prioritized Product Backlog, the Scrum Team collaborates with the Product Owner and business stakeholders to create project deliverables.
 

<br/>

The ***Implement*** phases' *Conduct Daily Standup* and *Refine Prioritized Product Backlog* processes and ***Review and Retrospect*** phase's *Retrospect Sprint* process, provide scope to the Scrum Core Team to discuss what has been completed and collaborate on what needs to be done. Therefore, the number of *Change Requests* from the customer and rework is minimized.


<br/>

### Risks are efficiently identified and mitigated.
*Risks* are identified and handled efficiently.

<ins>***Example*** </ins>  

Project risks are identified and assessed during the ***Initiate*** phase's *Develop Epic(s)* process, and ***Implement*** phases' *Create Deliverables* and *Conduct Daily Standup* processes by the Scrum Core Team members. The Scrum meeting tools such as the *Daily Standup Meeting*, *Sprint Planning Meeting*, *Prioritized Product Backlog Review Meeting*, and other meetings provide opportunities for the team identify and assess risks, as well as to efficiently implement risk responses.

<br/>

### Efficiency is increased.
The true potential of the team is realized. 

<ins>***Example*** </ins>

During ***Implement*** phase' *Conduct Daily Standup* process, it provides an opportunity for the Scrum Team to collaborate and understand each members' strengths and weaknesses. If a team member misses a task deadline, the Scrum Team collaborates to complete the tasks and meet the Sprint targets.

<br/>

### Continuous improvement is incorporated.
Continuous improvement is ensured through lessons learned.

<ins> ***Example*** </ins>

During ***Review and Retrospect*** phase's *Retrospect Sprint* process, the Scrum Team identifies what went well and what did not in the previous Sprint. This allows the Scrum Master to collaborate with the team to enhance their performance for the upcoming Sprint. This will also make collaboration more effective in the next sprint.

***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Principles | Page: 29 – 30

<br/>

## Importance of Colocation in Collaboration
Effective Scrum practices often require high-bandwidth communication, which is best achieved when team members are collocated. Preferred communication methods include face-to-face interactions, decision rooms, scrum boards, wall displays, shared tables, and other options. Co-location enables both formal and informal interactions among team members.

Some of the benefits of co-location include:
- Questions are answered promptly.
- Issues are resolved immediately.
- There is less friction between interactions.
- Trust is earned and granted much more quickly.

***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Principles | Page: 31

<br/> 

## Collaboration in Distributed Teams
While collocated teams are generally preferred, there are instances when the Scrum Team may be distributed. Scrum team members may work from various physical locations, including different cities or countries, and may also be working from home. Even when teams are collocated, members should have the flexibility to work remotely in case of extenuating circumstances that could affect the team's ability to function effectively in a collocated environment. In such situations, it may be necessary to ensure that Scrum Team members are set up to work effectively while distributed.

<br/>

### Scrum Project Tool
Utilizing a collaborative Scrum project tool is strongly advised to ensure team members work productively, especially when they are not located in the same workplace.

The Scrum Project Tool should ideally offer the following:
- Clearly define all Scrum roles and provide messaging and collaboration tools for team members to communicate effectively with each other.
- Develop and utilize key Scrum artifacts.
- Outline the workflow for different Scrum processes in the Initiate, Planning, Implement, Retrospect, and Release phases.
- Scale to organization or enterprise levels.
- Schedule essential Scrum meetings. These meetings can be arranged using a separate video conferencing tool.
- Facilitate easy online communication among Scrum Team members, whether one-on-one or via distributed groups and discussion forums.
- Document the lessons learned from retrospectives and similar activities, ensuring that relevant reports are generated in real-time.
- Implement automation to ensure that templates and guidance from the Scrum Guidance Body are accessible to all Scrum Teams within the organization.
- Allow the Scrum Guidance Body to evaluate Scrum-related practices.
- Clone similar projects, Epics, and User Stories to help Scrum Team members reduce time spent on unnecessary or duplicate documentation, while also learning from experiences of similar completed work.

<br/>

Benefits of using a Scrum Project Tool for distributed teams include the following:
- Facilitate Scrum Team members to work anytime and from any location.
- Automation of reporting, messaging, scheduling, workflows, and other items.
- Implementing standard guidelines throughout the organization by automating the recommendations from the Scrum Guidance Body.
- Increased efficiency achieved by reducing time spent on creating repetitive or unnecessary documentation when cloning similar projects.
- Collaborating with a more diverse team often brings in local perspectives and experiences.
- Fewer logistical challenges compared to those of having all team members in one location.

<br/>
 
# Value-based Prioritization

![Image – Value Based Prioritization](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/certifications/scrum-fundamentals-certification/assets/part-ii-principles/sfc-part-ii-principles-value-based-prioritization.png)


The Scrum framework focuses on delivering maximum business value in the shortest time possible. Prioritization is one of the most effective tools for ensuring the greatest value is achieved quickly. Prioritization is the process of determining what tasks must be done immediately versus those that can be addressed later. The traditional Waterfall model of project management employs a sequential process with multiple levels of task prioritization to manage projects effectively. It uses prioritization matrices to delegate tasks and certain tasks must be completed first to expedite the development process and achieve project goals. It uses prioritization matrices to assign tasks, ensuring that some must be completed first to accelerate the development process and achieve project goals.

<br/>

The Scrum framework employs <ins>***Value-based Prioritization***</ins> or <u>***Value-based Prioritization***</u> as a core principle for adaptability and iterative development, providing structure and functionality for development of product or service. Scrum focuses on delivering a valuable product or service to customers early and continuously. The Product Owner prioritizes User Stories in the Prioritized Product Backlog. After the Product Owner receives business requirements from the customer, they are documented as Epics and User Stories. The Product Owner collaborates with customers and business stakeholders to identify the business requirements that provide the most value. To effectively prioritize user stories, the Product Owner needs to understand what customers want and value, organizing the stories in a list from highest to lowest priority. The processes where the principle of Value-based Prioritization is applied include  ***Initiate*** phase's *Create a Prioritized Product Backlog* and ***Implement*** phase's *Refine Prioritized Product Backlog*.

<br/>

Simultaneously, the Product Owner must collaborate with the Scrum Team to identify project risks and uncertainties, as these may lead to negative consequences. It is important to consider this when prioritizing User Stories using a value-based approach. Additionally, the Scrum Team notifies the Product Owner of any dependencies arising from implementation.

<br/>

The Product Owner must translate the inputs and needs of project stakeholders to create a Prioritized Product Backlog. Prioritization leads to deliverables that meet customer requirements while maximizing business value in the shortest time possible. While prioritizing the User Stories in the Prioritized Product Backlog, the following three factors are considered:
- Value
- Risk or uncertainty
- Dependencies

***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Principles | Page: 33 - 34

<br/>

# Time-boxing
 
![Image – Time-Boxing](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/certifications/scrum-fundamentals-certification/assets/part-ii-principles/sfc-part-ii-principles-time-boxing.png)

Time is one of the most important factors in managing a Scrum project. To address this time constraint, Scrum introduces the concept of <ins>***Time-boxing***</ins>. This method involves establishing a predetermined duration for every process and activity within a Scrum project. This approach helps Scrum team members manage their workload effectively, avoiding both excess and insufficient work while preventing wasted time on unclear tasks.

<br/>

Some advantages of Time-boxing include:
- An efficient development process
- Reduced overhead
- Increased team velocity
- More focused team members
- Well-prepared individuals

<br/>

Time-boxing is essential in Scrum, helping to prevent excessive refinement of items. However, it must be applied carefully to avoid demotivating the team and creating a negative environment.

<br/>


## Scrum Time-boxes
### Sprint
A <ins>***Sprint***</ins> is a time-boxed iteration lasting one to four weeks, facilitated by the Scrum Master, who protects the Scrum Team from obstacles during the ***Implement*** phase's *Create Deliverables* process. During a Sprint, the Scrum Team transforms requirements from the Prioritized Product Backlog into shippable product features. This structure helps prevent scope creep that could affect the Sprint goal. Sprints should be kept as short as possible for flexibility, but long enough to produce a deliverable that the Product Owner can review and approve.

<br/>

### Sprint Planning Meeting
<ins>***Sprint Planning Meeting***</ins> is conducted prior to each Sprint as part of the ***Implement*** phase's *Commit User Stories*, *Identify Tasks*, *Estimate Tasks*, and *Update Sprint Backlog* processes. The time allocated for this activity is limited to two hours each week throughout the duration of the Sprint.

The Sprint Planning Meeting has the following objectives:
1. Objective Definition
   The Product Owner explains the highest-priority User Stories in the Prioritized Product Backlog to the Scrum Team. The Scrum Team collaborates with the Product Owner and then commits to the User Stories, which define the Sprint goal.
2. Task Identification and Estimation
   The Scrum Team decides how to complete the Prioritized Product Backlog items to achieve the Sprint goal, tracking committed User Stories and estimated tasks in the Sprint Backlog.

<br/>

### Daily Standup Meeting
The <ins>***Daily Standup Meeting***</ins> or <u>***Daily Standup Meeting***</u> is a short daily meeting, Time-boxed to 15 minutes. This meeting is carried out by the Scrum Team as part of the ***Implement*** phase's *Conduct Daily Standup* process. The team meets to share updates on the project by answering these three questions:
1. What have I done since the last meeting?
2. What do I plan to do before the next meeting?
3. What impediments or obstacles (if any) am I currently facing?

<br/>

### Sprint Review Meeting
The <ins>***Sprint Review Meeting***</ins> or <u>***Sprint Review Meeting***</u> is time-boxed to one hour for each week of the Sprint. During this meeting, held in the ***Review and Retrospect*** phase's *Demonstrate and Validate Sprint* process, the Scrum Team presents the current Sprint deliverables to the Product Owner, who reviews them against the Acceptance Criteria to either accept or reject the completed User Stories.

<br/>

### Retrospect Sprint Meeting
The <ins>***Retrospect Sprint Meeting***</ins> or <u>***Retrospect Sprint Meeting***</u> is Time-boxed to one hour each week of the Sprint duration during the Retrospect Sprint process of ***Review and Retrospect*** phase. In this meeting, the Scrum Team gathers to review and reflect on the current Sprint regarding the processes followed, tools used, collaboration and communication methods, and other relevant aspects of the project. The team reviews what went well and what didn’t in the previous sprint to learn and improve future sprints. Any identified best practices or improvement opportunities may be added to the Scrum Guidance Body.
