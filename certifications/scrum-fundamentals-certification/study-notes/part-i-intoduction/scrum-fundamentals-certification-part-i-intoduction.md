# Overview of Scrum
![Image Scrum's 7 Impediments)](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/certifications/scrum-fundamentals-certification/assets/part-i-intoduction/sfc-part-i-introduction-impediments.png)


## Agile Methodologies
Agile methodologies are focused on the four factors:
1. Value Driven Delivery
2. Adaptive Planning
3. Continuous Improvement
4. Active Stakeholder Engagement

## What is Scrum?
Scrum is one of the most popular Agile methodologies. It delivers value throughout a project expeditiously due to its adaptative, iterative, fast, flexible, and effective framework.

## Scum Impediments
A Scrum project involves a collaborative effort to create a new product, service, or other result as defined in the Project Vision Statement. Projects are impacted by impediments that makes it difficult for teams to plan, implement, manage, and deliver. Project impediments include the following:
1.	Time 
2.	Cost
3.	Scope
4.	Quality
5.	Resources
6.	Organizational Capabilities
7.	Other limitations

# Scrum Components

![Image - Scrum Components](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/certifications/scrum-fundamentals-certification/assets/part-i-intoduction/sfc-part-i-introduction-components.png)

## Scrum Components 
Scrum consist of three primary components: principles, aspects, and phases. SCRUMstudy's Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide is divided the into three areas: 
- Principles (Chapter 2)
- Aspects (Chapters 3 – 7)
- Phases (Chapters 8-– 12)
 
***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Introduction | Page: 7 
 
## Principles 
Scrum consists of six principles:
- Empirical Process Control
- Self-Organization
- Collaboration
- Value-based Prioritization
- Time-boxing
- Iterative Development
 
***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf) | Chapter: Introduction | Page: 9

## Aspects
Scrum consists of five aspects:
•	Organization
•	Business Justification
•	Quality
•	Change
•	Risk

## Phases
Scrum consists of five phases:

# Scrum Principles

![Image – 6 Principles](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/certifications/scrum-fundamentals-certification/assets/part-ii-principles/sfc-part-ii-title-principles.png)


## Empirical Process Control
An Empirical Process Control model helps make decisions based on observation and experimentation rather than on detailed upfront planning. It relies on the three main ideas of transparency, inspection, and Adaptation. 
 
***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf)  | Chapter: Glossary | Page: 363
 
## Self-Organization 
Scrum believes that employees are self-motivated and seek to accept greater responsibility. Hence, they deliver much greater value when self-organized. 
 
 ***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf)  | Chapter: Glossary | Page: 384
 
## Collaboration 
Collaboration in Scrum refers to the Scrum Core Team working together and interfacing with the stakeholders to create and validate the deliverables of the project to meet the goals outlined in the Project Vision. Collaboration occurs when a team works together to play off each other’s contributions to produce something greater. 
 
***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf)  | Chapter: Glossary | Page: 358
 
## Value-based Prioritization 
Scrum, however, uses Value-based Prioritization as one of the core principles that drives the structure and functionality of the entire Scrum framework—it helps projects benefit through adaptability and iterative development of the product or service. More significantly, Scrum aims at delivering a valuable product or service to the customer on an early and continuous basis. 
 
***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf)  | Chapter: Principles | Page: 33
 
## Time-boxing 
Time-boxing refers to setting short periods of time for work to be done. If the work undertaken remains 
incomplete at the end of the Time-box, it is moved into a subsequent Time-box. Time-boxes provide the 
structure needed for Scrum projects, which have an element of uncertainty, are dynamic in nature, and are prone to frequent changes. 
 
 ***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf)  | Chapter: Glossary | Page: 389
 
## Iterative Development
Iterative Development emphasizes how to better manage changes and build products that satisfy customer needs.

# Scrum Aspects

![Image – 5 Aspects](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/certifications/scrum-fundamentals-certification/assets/part-iii-aspects/sfc-part-iii-title-aspects.png)

## Organization
Organization with Scrum roles fall into two broad categories: core and non-core roles.
 
***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf)  | Chapter: Introduction | Page: 11, 12
 
## Business Justification
Business Justification demonstrates the reasons for undertaking a project. It answers the question “Why is this project needed?” Business justification drives all decision making related to a project.
 
***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf)  | Chapter: Glossary | Page: 357
 
## Quality
Quality is defined as the ability of the completed product or Deliverables to meet the Acceptance Criteria and achieve the business value expected by the customer.
 
***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf)  | Chapter: Glossary| Page: 375
 
## Change
Change is inevitable in all projects. A primary principle of Scrum is its acknowledgement that a) stakeholders (e.g., customers, users, and sponsors) do change their minds about what they want and need throughout a project (sometimes referred to as ‘requirements churn’) and b) that it is very difficult, if not impossible, for stakeholders to define all requirements during project initiation.
 
***Reference*** | Scrum Body of Knowledge, SBOK Guide | [4th Edition](https://github.com/jasmineMLewis/Articles/blob/Production/assets-general/scrumstudy-books-resources/scrumstudy-sbok-guide-fourth-edition.pdf)  | Chapter: Change | Page: 102
 
## Risk
Risk is defined as an uncertain event or set of events that can affect the objectives of a project and may
contribute to its success or failure.
