Before the event began, I visited Idea Village, The City of New Orleans, and Oschner.

Idea Village's representative discussed some application questions and how I can attend Yu-Gi-Oh events and ask questions about customers need. Furthermore, the vendors shared that I need to know what problem I am trying to solve. They advised I check their website periodically for the next cohort.

### The City of New Orleans 
I was interested in our great city's career opportunities. It was my first time participating in a NOLAvate's event and I was unaware I should have brought my resume. I signed the registration form and collected their business card.

### Oschner
I visited Oschner's table to learn about their available employment prospects and acquire cool swag. After speaking with their representatives, I discovered they are Microsoft-based and use .NET for software development.
